# My-Future-In-A-Folder
Hello reader, my name is Yusuf and I'm looking forward to explore furthur into the computer programmnig field.
Recently, I've been working/learning python and I'm finding it very interesting. Python is much more "flexible" 
you can say comparing it to Turing (another language I have programmed with).  
My interest into programming all started when I started to play games. I thought to myself and got curiuos how
games were made bringing me to who I am today. I hope you learn or find anything interesting from my
work that is soon going to be made in the upcoming future.
